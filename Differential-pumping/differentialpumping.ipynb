Differential pumping tube\n","\n","Size of the differential pumping tube can impose limitations to partical transport process (molecular beam divergence, etc). The following considerations mainly follow the Rb differential pumping tube design.\n","\n","## 1.1 Science chamber pressure\n","The science chamber will be connected to the capture chamber via a differential pumping tube of conductance $C$. And there will be a pump of pumping speed $S$ at the science chamber side. In this simple model, if we assume the science chamber pressure $P_{\\mathrm{sci}}$ is much less than the capture chamber pressure $P_{\\mathrm{cap}}$, $P_{\\mathrm{sci}}$ can be calculated by\n","\\begin{align}\n","P_{\\mathrm{sci}} = \\frac{C}{S}P_{\\mathrm{cap}}.\n","\\end{align}\n","\n","## 1.2 Conductance\n","Given our low vacuum pressure, we are in the molecular flow regime. Only formulas in this regime are given below. References are listed at the end of the section.\n","\n","### 1.2.1 Orifice\n","An orifice is an ideal opening (not necessarily round) without thickness. Its conductance can be calculated by \n","\\begin{align}\n","C_{\\mathrm{ori}} = A\\sqrt{\\frac{k_BT}{2\\pi m}},\n","\\end{align}\n","where $T$ is temperature, $m$ is partical mass, and $A$ is cross-section area of the orifice. To simplify the equation, we can substitute constants with concrete numbers, and get\n","\\begin{align}\n","C_{\\mathrm{ori}} = 3.64A\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{M}}.\n","\\end{align}\n","Here $C$ is conductance in liter/s, $T$ is temperature in Kelvin, $M$ is mass in atomic mass unit (e.g. 87 for $^{87}$Rb), and $A$ is cross section area in cm$^2$.\n","\n","### 1.2.2 Long cylindrical tube\n","The conducatance of a long tube ($l\\gg d$) can be calculated by\n","\\begin{align}\n","C_{\\mathrm{l,\\ cyl}} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\frac{d^3}{l}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_BT}{2\\pi m}},\n","\\end{align}\n","where $T$ is temperature, $m$ is partical mass, $d$ is the diameter of the tube and $l$ is its length. Similarly we can plug in numbers for physical contants to simplify the equation. It can be obtained that\n","\\begin{align}\n","C_{\\mathrm{l,\\ cyl}} = 3.81\\frac{d^3}{l}\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{M}}.\n","\\end{align}\n","Here both $l$ and $d$ are in cm, and other quantities have the same units as above.\n","\n","### 1.2.3 Short cylindrical tube\n","The above equation starts to fail when $l$ is not very large compared to $d$. An approximate way to correct it is to treat the short tube as a tube in series with an orifice (of the same cross section as the tube) and use the long tube equation to calculate the tube conductance. By the standard equation for ducts in series, the total conductance can be calculated as\n","\\begin{align}\n","\\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{s,\\ cyl}}} = \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{l,\\ cyl}}}+\\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{ori}}}.\n","\\end{align}\n","It's discussed in Ref. \\[2\\] and \\[3\\] that this method is not the whole story and can give up 12% error. More accurate treatments are given in both references, but I think 12% error should be good enough for us. \n","\n","### 1.2.4 Tapered tube\n","In our experiment, tapered tubes may be preferred over cylindrical tubes of uniform cross section, because it can limit conductance while fit the atomic/molecular beam divergence to maximize flux. A tapered tube can fabricated by Wire EDM process. The formula for long tapered tube conductance is given in Ref. \\[3\\]. It's the same as the equation for long cylindrical tubes except the diameter has to be replaced by the equivalent diameter $d_e$ defined as\n","\\begin{align}\n","d_e = \\left(\\frac{2d_1^2d_2^2}{d_1+d_2}\\right)^{1/3},\n","\\end{align}\n","where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are diameters at tube entrance and exit. The document doesn't give an equation for short tapered tube, but I guess, with an acceptable error, it can also be treated as a combination of a \"long\" tube and an orifice in series.\n","\n","### References\n","1.
